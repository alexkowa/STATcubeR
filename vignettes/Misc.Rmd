```{r, include = FALSE}
pkgload::load_all(export_all = FALSE, reset = FALSE, helpers = FALSE) 
```

There is experimental support for the endpoints [`/info`] and
[`/rate_limit`]. However, those endpoints are not exported by now.


```{r}
STATcubeR:::sc_get_info() %>% httr::content()
STATcubeR:::sc_get_rate_limit() %>% httr::content()
```

STATcube uses caching for the `/table` endpoint by default. If the same
request to `sc_post_json()` is sent several times, this will not count
towards the rate-limit (100 requests per hour).
