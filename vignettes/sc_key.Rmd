Instructions for the first-time use of the STATcube REST API.

## Adding an API key

In order to use the REST API of STATcube it is necessary to provide an API key.
This means that you will need a subscription for STATcube.
Subscribed users will automatically get access to the STATcube API.
The API key can be displayed under the preferences menu of STATcube

```
http://sdbext:8081/statistik.at/ext/statcube/jsf/preferences/editPreferences.xhtml
```

To make the key available for `r STATcubeR`, use the function
`sc_key_set()`. Replace `"XXXX"` with your key.

```r
sc_key_set("XXXX")
#> The provided key will be available for this R session. Add
#>
#>   STATCUBE_KEY=XXXX
#>
#> to your .Renviron to set the key persistently
```

As suggested by the code output, the key can be set persistently by modifying
`.Renviron`. This can be done easily with `usethis::edit_r_environ()`.

## How do I get an API key?

Currently, the api is only available inside the firewall of statistics austria.
Therefore, api keys can only be requested by our employees. Api access for
external users with a statcube subscription is planned in the near future.
Please get into contact with the package maintainers of `r STATcubeR` for details.

## Next Steps

See the `r ticle('sc_table')` to see how tables can be defined in the STATcube GUI and imported into R.
Alternatively, import a saved table by following the `r ticle('sc_table_saved')`.
